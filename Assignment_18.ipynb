        "Supervised learning involves training a model using labeled data, where the desired output or target variable is provided alongside the input data. The goal is to learn a mapping or function that can predict the correct output when presented with new, unseen data. In supervised learning, the model learns from the labeled examples and adjusts its parameters to minimize the prediction error.\n",

        "By leveraging the Apriori principle, the algorithm avoids exhaustive measurement of all possible itemset combinations, which can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. Instead, it prunes unpromising itemsets early in the process.\n",
