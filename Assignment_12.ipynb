        "Naïve Bayes classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the features (input variables) are conditionally independent of each other given the class label. Despite this \"naïve\" assumption, the algorithm often performs surprisingly well and is widely used in various applications, especially in text classification and spam filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "The name \"naïve\" in Naïve Bayes classifier comes from the fact that it simplifies the computation by assuming independence among the features. In other words, it treats each feature as if it contributes independently to the probability of a particular class label.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assumption of feature independence makes the algorithm computationally efficient and allows it to handle a large number of features with limited computational resources. However, in real-world scenarios, the assumption of feature independence may not hold true for all datasets. Despite this simplifying assumption, Naïve Bayes classifier often performs well in practice, especially when the independence assumption is reasonably satisfied or when there is a lack of sufficient training data to estimate complex relationships among features.\n",

        "The Naïve Bayes classifier calculates the probability of a given class label for a given set of features using Bayes' theorem. It estimates the prior probabilities of each class based on the training data and then computes the likelihood probabilities of the features given the class labels. By combining these probabilities, the algorithm can classify new instances based on their feature values.\n",

It represents the ideal classifier that achieves the lowest possible error rate when classifying data points into different classes.\n",

As a result, practical classifiers are often designed to approximate the optimal Bayes classifier based on available training data.\n",

While this assumption simplifies the model and makes computation more efficient, it may not hold true in many real-world scenarios.

This weakness is especially evident when dealing with complex datasets where the correlations among features are significant.\n",

It assumes specific probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian, multinomial) for the features, and if these assumptions do not hold true in the actual data, the classifier's performance may suffer. In cases where the true feature distributions differ significantly from the assumed distributions, the Bayes classifier may provide suboptimal results and struggle to capture the underlying patterns in the data.\n",

The Naïve Bayes classifier then learns the conditional probabilities of each class given the feature values. During the classification phase, the classifier calculates the posterior probability of each class for a given document and assigns it to the class with the highest probability.\n",
