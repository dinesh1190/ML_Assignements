        "Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. In this paradigm, the training data consists of input-output pairs, where each input is associated with a corresponding correct output or label. The goal of supervised learning is to train a model that can generalize from the given examples and accurately predict the correct output for new, unseen inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The significance of the name \"supervised learning\" stems from the fact that during the training process, the algorithm is provided with supervision or guidance in the form of labeled data. This supervision allows the algorithm to learn the underlying patterns and relationships between the input and output variables. By using this guidance, the algorithm can make predictions or classifications for new, unseen data points.\n",

        "The concept of supervision is crucial because it enables the algorithm to learn from known correct answers and adjust its internal parameters or structure to minimize the difference between its predictions and the true labels. The algorithm tries to generalize the patterns observed in the training data, enabling it to make accurate predictions for future, unlabeled instances."

        "The main idea behind SVM is to find the best hyperplane that separates the data points of different classes in a way that maximizes the margin between the two classes. The hyperplane is a decision boundary that divides the feature space into two regions, each representing a separate class. SVM aims to find the hyperplane with the largest distance or margin to the nearest data points of each class.\n",
