Once a chunk is processed, it can be discarded from memory to make space for the next chunk. This process continues until all the data has been processed.\n",

In core learning, the entire dataset is loaded into memory, allowing for faster and more efficient computation as the model can access the data directly without the need for disk I/O operations. However, this approach may not be feasible or practical when the dataset size exceeds the memory capacity.\n",

It leverages disk I/O operations to read and process data in smaller batches, allowing models to learn from datasets that do not fit entirely in memory. This technique enables the training of models on massive datasets, making it suitable for big data applications.\n",

        "\n",
        "The purpose of a validation set, also known as a development set or holdout set, is to assess and fine-tune the performance of a machine learning model during the training process. It serves as an intermediate dataset between the training set and the final evaluation on the test set.\n",

        "\n",
        "Hyperparameter Tuning: Machine learning models often have hyperparameters that need to be set before training. Hyperparameters are configuration choices that influence the learning process but are not learned from the data. Examples include the learning rate in neural networks or the regularization parameter in regression models. The validation set helps in finding the optimal values for these hyperparameters by evaluating different combinations and selecting the ones that result in the best performance on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model Selection: In scenarios where multiple models or algorithms are being considered, the validation set is used to compare their performance. By training and evaluating different models on the validation set, you can identify the model that performs the best and select it as the final model to deploy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early Stopping: Training a model can involve multiple iterations or epochs. Early stopping is a technique that monitors the model's performance on the validation set during training and stops the training process if the performance starts to deteriorate. This prevents overfitting and helps find the point where the model achieves the best trade-off between training performance and generalization.\n",

        "The key aspect of the validation set is that it provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance during training. It helps in making decisions regarding hyperparameters, model selection, and controlling the learning process to prevent overfitting. It serves as a guide for model refinement and ensures that the final model is optimized for both training performance and generalization to unseen data."
