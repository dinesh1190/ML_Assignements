When multicollinearity is present, it becomes challenging to separate the individual effects of correlated variables, leading to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. Multicollinearity can also inflate the standard errors of the coefficients, making it difficult to identify statistically significant predictors. To address multicollinearity, one may consider removing one of the correlated variables, obtaining more data, or utilizing advanced techniques like principal component analysis (PCA) or ridge regression.\n",

        "Violations of these assumptions can affect the validity and reliability of the regression results. For instance, if the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables is nonlinear, using a linear regression model may lead to inaccurate predictions and interpretations. Violations of the assumption of independence, such as autocorrelation in time series data, can result in inefficient coefficient estimates. It is essential to assess and address the assumptions through diagnostic checks and, if necessary, consider alternative modeling techniques or transformations to improve the validity of the regression analysis.\n",

It is a widely used technique in various fields, including regression analysis, time series analysis, and machine learning. Here are the key details of maximum likelihood estimation:\n",

        "Likelihood Function: The likelihood function measures the probability of observing the given data as a function of the model parameters.

Common optimization methods include gradient descent, Newton-Raphson, and Fisher scoring.
